# Tictactoe
The Tic Tac Toe game project in Python is a beginner-friendly introduction to basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and handling user input. This project implements a console-based version of the classic game for two players on the same computer.
Gameplay Mechanics: Two players take turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid, with one player using 'X' and the other 'O'. The game runs in the terminal or command prompt.
Objective: The first player to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game is declared a tie.
